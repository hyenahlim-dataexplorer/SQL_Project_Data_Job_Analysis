## 📌 Introduction
This project explroes the job market for Data Analysts with a focus on remote opportunities, salaries, and in-demand skills. By leveraging SQL queries on a structured job postings dataset, the analysis identifies high-paying roles, required skills, and optimal skill sets for career development.

## 🏗 Background
The demand for Data Analysts has grown significantly as organizations become increasingly data-driven. Job seekers often face two key questions:
1. Which companies offer the highest-paying Data Analyst roles?
2. What skills are both in demand and associated with higher salaries?
This project addresses these questions by analyzing a dataset of job postings and extracting insights to guide aspiring analysts and career professionals.

## 🛠 Tools I Used
* **PostgreSQL** → For data querying and analysis.
* **Visual Studio Code** → For query development, debugging, and project organization.
* **Git & GitHub** → For version control and portfolio presentation.

## 📊 The Analysis
Five main SQL queries:
1. **Top-Paying Jobs** → Identified the top 10 highest-paying remote Data Analyst roles with disclosed salaries.
2. **Skills for High-Paying Roles** → Extracted the specific skills required for these top-paying jobs.
3. **Most In-Demand Skills** → Found the top 5 skills most frequently requested in all Data Analyst job postings.
4. **Top Skills by Salary** → Calculated average salaries associated with each skill to reveal which ones yield the greatest financial return.
5. **Optimal Skills** (High Demand + High Salary) → Combined demand and salary insights to pinpoint the most strategic skills to learn.

## 🎯 What I learned
* How to structure complex SQL queries using CTEs, joins, grouping, and aggregations.
* The importance of data cleaning (removing null salaries) before meaningful analysis.
* How to balance market demand (job security) with salary potential (financial growth) when identifying career skills.
* Practical experience with SQL-driven market research that can be applied to real-world business intellignece tasks.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be leveraged to extract actionable insights from job postings data. The results highlight both career opportunities (top-paying companies and jobs) and skill strategies (balancing high demand with salary potential).

For aspiring Data Analysts, the key takeaway is clear:

* Master foundational tools (SQL, Excel, Python).
* Learn visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI).
* Develop expertise in cloud and big data technologies (AWS, Azure, Snowflake).

By focusing on these areas, job seekers can position themselves competitively in a rapidly evolving market.
