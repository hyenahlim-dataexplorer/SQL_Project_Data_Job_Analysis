# Data Job Market Analytics: Insights into Hiring, Skills, Salaries, and Trends
## üìå Introduction
The data job market is rapidly evolving, shaped by advancements in AI, cloud technologies, and global hiring practices. This project analyzes real-world job postings data to uncover trends in hiring companies, compensation, skills demand, and geographic distribution. By leveraging SQL for querying and aggregating, the analysis provides data-driven insights into what drives opportunities in the data field.

**Main Character (Y)**: Data-related jobs (the central narrative)
**Sub-main Characters (X)**: Salaries, Skills, Location, Company, and Time (the factors shaping the story).

The analysis treats the job market as a dynamic ecosystem where the main character (data roles) is influenced by multiple forces (sub-main characters).

## üìÇ Background
* Dataset: Job postings fact table and supporting dimension tables (titles, companies, skills, location)
* Purpose: Explore hiring demand, salary structures, skills premium, and geographic distribution using SQL queries.
* Approach: A question-driven analysis where each query answers a targeted job market question.

## üõ† Tools & Environment
* **SQL Engine**: PostgreSQL
* **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
* **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
* **Visualization & Storytelling**: R, Notion (for non-technical presentation)
